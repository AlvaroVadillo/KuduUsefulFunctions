Here's a Java client sample that creates a table, writes some data, scans it, and then deletes
its table.


To build and run, do the following:

$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/kudu-java-sample-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

This example assumes that you are running the Quickstart VM with the host name
"quickstart.cloudera". If you are running against a different cluster, pass the
host name of the Kudu Master using a Java property:

$ java -DkuduMaster=a1216.halxg.cloudera.com -jar target/kudu-java-sample-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
